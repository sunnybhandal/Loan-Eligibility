The purpose of this project was to get comfortable with pipelines and deploying our models.

### Topics
This project is dedicated to the following topics:
- Data Wrangling (manually and then using pipelines)
- Data Visualization (Confusion matrices, pandas pivot tables, feature importance graphs)
- Data Preparation and Feature Engineering (logarithmic and standard scaler transformation)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA and SelectKBest)
- Supervised Learning (Logisitic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier)
- Pipelines
- Model Deployment through API creation

### Try it Yourself
- Download the api.py file
- In the same directory, download the model.p file
- Make an API request and pass through JSON formatted data (found in the jupyter notebook)
